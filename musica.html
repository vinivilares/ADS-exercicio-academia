    <h3>Calvin Harris - This Is What You Came For</h3>
    <p>Baby, this is what you came for<br>
        Lightning strikes every time she moves<br>
        And everybody's watching her<br>
        But she's looking at you, ooh, ooh<br>
        You, ooh, ooh, you, ooh, ooh<br>
        You, ooh, ooh, you, ooh, ooh<br>

        Ooh<br>
        We go fast with the game we play<br>
        Who knows why it's gotta be this way?<br>
        We say nothing more than we need<br>
        I say "your place" when we leave<br>
        Baby, this is what you came for<br>
        Lightning strikes every time she moves<br>
        And everybody's watching her<br>
        But she's looking at you, ooh, ooh<br>
